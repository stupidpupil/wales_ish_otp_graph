This is an OpenTripPlanner network graph for planning trips, by car or public transport, between places in Wales - including where these trips involve a short journey entirely within England. (It likely also works well enough for planning trips between places in Wales and a small number of English towns just the other side of the border.)

The map shows bus and train routes included in the latest graph, giving a rough idea of the region included.

## How to use this

The graph file was last updated at `r file.mtime("output/opentripplanner/graph.obj")  %>% strftime("%H:%M %Z on %d %B %Y", tz="Europe/London")`. (The graph should update weekly.)

[Download the latest release of the Wales-ish OTP graph here](https://github.com/stupidpupil/wales_ish_otp_graph/releases/latest). You'll need to download the *otp_and_graph.zip* asset.

You can then start OpenTripPlanner using *run-otp.bat* (under Windows) or *run-otp.sh* (under Linux or macOS). Eventually it'll print "Started listener bound to [0.0.0.0:8080]" and you'll be able to access the planner at `http://localhost:8080` .

(You'll need [install Java 17](https://adoptium.net). See the [OTP documentation](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/) for more information.)

## Test Journeys

A small number of journeys, departing on Tuesday morning the following week, are tested every time that the graph is built. The results from the latest update of the graph are shown below.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}

seconds_as_hhmm <- function(secs){
  hrs <- secs %/% (60*60)
  mins <- round((secs %% (60*60))/60)
  ifelse(is.na(secs), "N/A", sprintf("%1ih%2im",hrs, mins))
}

readr::read_csv("output/test_journeys.csv") %>% mutate(
    publicDescription = ifelse(public, "Public", "Car"),
    durationDescription = seconds_as_hhmm(durationSeconds)) %>%
    select(Description, publicDescription, durationDescription) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(Description, names_from=publicDescription, values_from=durationDescription) %>%
  arrange(Description) %>%
  (knitr::kable)

```

This project developed out of a [NHS Welsh Modelling Collaborative](https://twitter.com/nhswmc) hackathon, with the support of colleagues across NHS Wales including James Cooke of the Welsh Ambulance Service.

It depends entirely on the work done by [OpenStreetMap contributors](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Malcolm Morgan (University of Leeds, Institute for Transport Studies) and UK2GTFS contributors](https://itsleeds.github.io/UK2GTFS/), [Traveline](https://www.travelinedata.org.uk/), the [*osmium* developers](https://osmcode.org/), and of course the [OpenTripPlanner developers](http://www.opentripplanner.org/).

Important inspiration included the [*graphite* project](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/graphite) produced as part of [a piece of work by the ONS Data Campus](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/access-to-services-using-multimodal-transport-networks/). Also of note is the [*OTP4GB* project](https://github.com/odileeds/OTP4GB) and [other work by ODI Leeds](https://odileeds.org/blog/2021-06-08-transportaccessibilityinnorthengland).
